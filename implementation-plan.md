# Blog UI Implementation Plan

We have successfully implemented the first blog sample (Classic News) with a responsive design that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop views. The CSS is completely decoupled from the React components as requested, with separate CSS files for each media query.

## Completed Work
1. **Project Structure**: Created a well-organized folder structure that allows for easy addition of new blog samples
2. **Sample Data**: Created JSON files for articles, authors, categories, and comments that will be reused across all samples
3. **Data Context**: Implemented a context system to provide data to all components
4. **Shared Components**: Created reusable components like Author and ArticleCard
5. **Classic News Blog Sample**: 
   - Implemented a traditional news/magazine layout
   - Created responsive designs for mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Used the provided color palette
   - Ensured complete separation of CSS from React components

## Implementation Strategy

For each blog sample, we will:

1. Create a new directory in the `blog-samples` folder
2. Implement the main component and subcomponents
3. Create separate CSS files for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
4. Register the new sample in the main App.js selector
5. Update the index.html to include the new CSS files with appropriate media queries

This modular approach will allow us to:
- Keep individual component files small and focused
- Reuse shared components and data across samples
- Maintain a clean separation between markup and styling
- Easily add or modify samples without affecting others

## Common Elements Across All Samples

While each sample will have its unique design, certain elements will remain consistent:
- The underlying data structure
- Basic accessibility features
- Responsive design principles
- Color palette based on the provided CSS

By following this implementation plan, we'll create a comprehensive set of blog UI options that showcase different approaches to blog design while maintaining a cohesive system using the specified color palette.
