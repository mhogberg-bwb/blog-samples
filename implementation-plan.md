# Blog UI Implementation Plan (Revised)

We have simplified the scope of the blog samples application to focus on core UI patterns, making it easier to maintain and extend across all 12 planned blog UI samples.

## Simplified Scope

Based on the revised requirements, we have made the following simplifications:

1. **Removed unnecessary UI elements**:
   - No top bar with date and sign-in links
   - No navigation menu with categories
   - No newsletter subscription component
   - Removed hero section

2. **Simplified component hierarchy**:
   - Focused on essential blog layout components
   - Changed from Categories to Tags for article filtering
   - Maintained only critical UI patterns that will be shared across samples

## Common Class Naming Convention

All blog samples will follow a consistent class naming pattern to ensure maintainability and clarity:

- Each blog sample will use a unique two-letter prefix (e.g., `cn-` for Classic News)
- Common UI patterns will maintain the same naming structure, with only the prefix changing between samples

### Example Class Structure

```
[prefix]-container
[prefix]-header
[prefix]-main
[prefix]-content
[prefix]-sidebar
[prefix]-footer
[prefix]-featured-article
[prefix]-article-list
```

## Blog Sample Component Structure

Each blog sample will maintain a consistent component structure:

1. **Header**: Simple header with logo and search functionality
2. **Main Content**:
   - Featured Article: Highlighted main article
   - Article List: Grid or list of remaining articles
3. **Sidebar**:
   - Tags: Filter articles by topic
   - Popular Articles: Showcase trending content
4. **Footer**: Simple footer with about info and social links

## Mobile Responsiveness

All blog samples will include consistent responsive behavior:

- Mobile: Single column layout with stacked components
- Tablet: Enhanced layout with appropriate spacing
- Desktop: Full multi-column layout

## CSS Organization

CSS will be organized consistently across all samples with clear sections for:

- Base styles and reset
- Layout components (container, main, content areas)
- UI components (articles, sidebar elements, etc.)
- Media queries
